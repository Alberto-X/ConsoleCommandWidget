--To find out someone's userid, look at the game log file at
--C:\Users\[username]\Documents\Klei\DoNotStarveTogether\client_log.txt
--When a player joins, the line in the log will look like this:
--[00:02:43]: Client authenticated: (KU_KozvIklj)
--The string at the very end (without the parentheses) is the userid. This will usually be followed by
--their username. You can search for it using ctrl + f. Then all you have to do is paste it anywhere
--below this message and it must be the only text on that line. (without the -- before it).
--DO NOT put any spaces or empty rows/lines before or after the userid(s). Put them immediately
--under this line.
